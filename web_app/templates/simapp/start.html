        What is GENZ Thrusters?</p>

    <p style ="padding-left: 20px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">
        This particle simulator was built to optimize the geometry of a rocket thruster. This problem we identified and decided to solve was a unique but cumulative common interest in the dynamics and launching of rockets. We wanted to determine the optimal form of a rocket thruster in terms of geometry
         and efficiency of the nozzle design. There are many launches that take place over the world from SpaceX's Starlink to NASA's Mars Exploration Rover that have inspired us to wonder at what can be achieved in optimizing the most plausible and efficient rocket thruster there can be.</p>

        Why does GENZ Thrusters incorporate a Genetic Algorithm and a Particle Simulator?</p>

    <p style ="padding-left: 20px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">
        A genetic algorithm is a simple algorithm which allows us to create a very complex object with very little apriori knowledge of how the system works. Concretely, this means that without knowing about what makes a thruster a good one versus a bad one, we are able to iteratively generate a progressively better thruster. All we have to specify is the physics of the problem (i.e. we just need to calculate the thrust from a particular thruster). <br>
        <br>
        To do this, we use a simple custom particle simulator. Each particle is a high energy particle which is supposed to mimic the conditions of a hot gas (the fuel of a typical rocket thruster). We easily calculate the thrust generated from a particular geometry of thruster, and use this to define how well a thruster is doing.

        Future Ideas for the project</p>

    <ul style ="padding-left: 33px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">
        <li>Optimizing further not just the nozzle of the thruster but as well as the complete geometry of the thruster.
            </li>
        <li>Adding performance optimizations such as multi-threading.</li>
        <li>Adding fields and intermolecular forces. Atmospheric particles is a possibility as well.</li>
        </ul>
